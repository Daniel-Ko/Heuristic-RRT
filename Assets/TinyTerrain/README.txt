===================

To see some examples of terrain generated by TinyTerrain, open a sample scene in TinyTerrain/Scenes and click the Play button.

To create new terrain, select Assets->Create->TinyTerrain Config from the menu bar. In the inspector window, adjust terrain parameters and click "build" to generate the terrain in the current scene. You can further customize the terrain by generating a texture or prefabs to apply to the terrain. Once the terrain is built, you will then have options to generate surface textures or place prefabs on the terrain through callback scripts. Hover over the configuration field names for useful tooltips.
